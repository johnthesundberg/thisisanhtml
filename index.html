      <div class="column"><h4>The Bicycle Shop</h4><p class="pbackground">Orville and Wilbur Wright moved around quite a bit throughout their life, but eventually, their family settled on Dayton Ohio. Both Wilbur and Orville Wright did well in school, but neither ended up attending colleg. Wilbur had made plans to attend Yale University, but an ice skating injury prevented him from doing so. Their father, Milton, was a church leader who had to move around frequently for work. On one of is trips, he sent home a rubber band powered helicopter, of which the brothers made several copies. </p></div>
